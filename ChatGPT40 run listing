### Explanation:
- **Vector Initialization:** Two vectors `vec1` and `vec2` are initialized.
- **Vector Addition/Subtraction:** Element-wise addition and subtraction between the two vectors.
- **Dot Product:** The dot product is calculated using the `sum()` function, multiplying corresponding elements.
- **Scalar Multiplication:** Each element of `vec1` is multiplied by a scalar (in this case, 2.0).
- **Vector Magnitude:** The magnitude (Euclidean norm) of the vectors is computed using the sum of squares.
